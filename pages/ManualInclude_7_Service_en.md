## 7. Service Framework (Service)
+ **JLGames.GameDriver.CSharp.Service** provides the basic interface and behavior specification of the service framework.
+ **JLGames.GameDriver.Actions.Service** provides service configuration assets for Unity (**not enabled**).
+ **JLGames.GameDriver.Games.Service** provides common service functions.

### 7.1 Design Purpose
Game projects have some obvious characteristics: high degree of data coupling and strong system dependence.  
So the entire game project can easily evolve into a **monolithic software**.  
As there are more modules in the system, the monolithic architecture becomes more complex. In addition, the interleaving of new functions and modification of old functions affects each other and is ultimately difficult to manage.  
In order to solve or reduce the impact of the above problems, combined with the idea of **service-oriented architecture(SOA)**, here is a solution and solve the following problems::  

+ Realize logical separation of business modules
  + Logical separation between different businesses
  + Logical separation of data and display under the same business
+ Extended support for normalized business modules
+ Unify the specification of cross-business behavior calls

### 7.2 Design Ideas
+ How to divide the service and how to grasp the granularity
  1. All businesses in the range from "game login complete" to "game logout start" are regarded as service division objects.
  2. Divide service units on a regular basis. The division rules are as follows:
     + Priority is given to dividing the game business and obtaining a functional system.
     + The functional system is further divided according to data, display and management to obtain service units.
     + Data reading and writing are isolated through the interface.
  3. Design a functional open interface (read-only interface) for each service unit.
  4. The communication between service units adopts the event mechanism.
+ According to the idea of ​​IOC, extended business services are added to the service framework management in the form of injection.
+ According to the design idea of ​​the game engine, an interface function called at a fixed timing is added to the extended business service, which is used for initializing data, releasing data or special logic implementation inside the service.
+ All extension services are managed by the framework, which is convenient for unified processing of initialization, update and release.

### 7.3 Interface description

#### 7.3.1 Service Basics
+ **IService**
  Only the class that implements the IService interface can be identified as a service and added to the framework management.  
  The ServiceName property returns the service name, which is required to be **unique**.  
+ **IEventDispatcher**
  The timing management of the service depends on the [event module](), so the service implementation class is required to implement the IEventDispatcher interface.  
+ **ServiceBase**
  Implement some necessary functions of the service class, which can be used for inheritance.  
+ **IProgressingService**
  Provides a service interface for **progress update**.  
  Triggers a progress update when the service instance throws the **ServiceEvents.OnServiceProcessing** event.  
  The service instance requires the attribute functions of **total progress** and **current progress**.

#### 7.3.2 Service initialization related
Execution timing: IArgumentService -> IAWakableService -> IInitService  
+ **IArgumentService**
  Provides a service interface for parameter injection  
  The completion of the function execution represents the end of the process of **injecting parameters**.  
  ![image](assets/img/service_1.png)  
+ **IAWakableService**
  A service interface that provides **activation** logic.  
  The completion of the function execution represents the end of the **activation** process.  
  ![image](assets/img/service_2.png)  
+ **IInitService**
  A service interface that provides **initialization** logic.  
  When the service instance throws the **ServiceEvents.OnServiceInited** event, it means the **initialization** process ends.  
  ![image](assets/img/service_3.png)  
+ **IInitDataService**
  A service interface that provides **data initialization** logic.  
  When the service instance throws the **ServiceEvents.OnServiceDataInited** event, it means the **data initialization** process ends.  
  ![image](assets/img/service_4.png)  

#### 7.3.3 Management scheduling related
+ **IClearService**
  A service interface that provides **cleanup** logic.  
  Mostly used for data reset, event removal and other logic.  
  The completion of the function execution means the end of the cleanup process.  
  ![image](assets/img/service_5.png)  
+ **ILoadDataService**
  Provides a service interface for data loading logic.  
  When the service instance throws the **ServiceEvents.OnServiceLoaded** event, it means the **data loading** process ends.  
  ![image](assets/img/service_6.png)  
+ **ISaveDataService**
  Provides a service interface for **data storage** logic.  
  When the service instance throws the **ServiceEvents.OnServiceSaved** event, it means the **data saving** process ends.

### <span id="7.4">7.4 How to use the framework
Before getting the service to use, it must be registered to the framework management, and then can be used after initialization. This is to ensure that the data has been processed completely.  

#### 7.4.1 Register the service to the framework management
By calling the AddConfig function in the ServiceConfig instance, the service can be registered with the framework management.  
`ServiceConfig.Shared.AddConfig(new ServiceInfo(serviceName, serviceImpl, args));`
![image](assets/img/service_14.png)  
**Suggest**:  
1. Manage the registration logic with a class dedicated to handling registration services. Such as ServiceRegister in the example.
2. Registration logic calls should be guaranteed to be unique.

#### 7.4.2 Service initialization
Start initialization by calling the **StartInitalization** function in the **ServiceManager** instance.  
**Note**: It should not be called repeatedly after initialization has started.  
![image](assets/img/service_15.png)  

#### 7.4.3 Service call
After the initial completion of all services, the service instance can be obtained by calling the **GetService** function in **ServiceConfig**.  
There are multiple functions for obtaining service instances in ServiceConfig, but the GetService function is ultimately called.  
![image](assets/img/service_16.png)  
**Suggest**:  

1. Manage the acquisition logic using a class that specifically manages acquiring service instances. Such as ServiceCenter in the example.

#### 7.4.4 Service cleanup
When the game is to achieve a soft restart, it is necessary to reset all services and then reinitialize.  
All services can be reset by calling **ClearServices** in **ServiceManager**.  
Only services that implement the IClearService interface will perform reset logic.  
![image](assets/img/service_17.png)  
![image](assets/img/service_5.png)  
**Suggest**:  

1. Each service is recommended to implement the IClearService interface.
2. In the Clear function in the IClearService interface, also clear all event listeners.
